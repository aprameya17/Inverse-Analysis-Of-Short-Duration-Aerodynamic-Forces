# Inverse Analysis Of Short-Duration Aerodynamic Forces

This is my Bachelor's Thesis Project at IIT-Guwahati which I'm pursuing under the guidance of Dr. Niranjan Sahoo.
The objective is to study the behavior of short-duration impulse forces and their recovery. 
Me and my BTP partner have so far acquired data experimentally and also by building a blunt cone model using CAD and acquired data using ANSYS.
We have tried to incorporate Machine Learning Models and show why they are better/more accurate as compared to traditional mechanical methods, like deconvolution.
